DatapathFix is an experimental Frosty plugin to fix an issue with modding games on platforms other than Origin (EA Desktop, Epic Games Store, Steam), where mods do not appear in the game.

### Notes
- This method works with games like NFS Heat
- May break anti-cheat depending on the game (Use at your own risk)
- Kinda hacky method so may not work perfectly/as expected

### Troubleshooting
- If EA Desktop tells you that you do not own the game, restart it through the in-app restart button
- If the game shows up as "DatapathFix" in Frosty, try to launch the game like normal and it should fix itself
- Make sure to disable the LaunchPlatformPlugin that comes with Frosty
