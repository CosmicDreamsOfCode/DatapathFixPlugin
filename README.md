# DatapathFixPlugin

Experimental Frosty plugin to allow modding for games on EA Desktop

### Notes
- This method works with games like NFS Heat
- May break anti-cheat depending on the game (Use at your own risk)
- Kinda hacky method so may not work perfectly/as expected

### Troubleshooting
- If EA Desktop tells you that you do not own the game, restart it through the in-app restart button
- If the game shows up as "DatapathFix" in Frosty, relaunch the game through Frosty and it should fix itself
- Make sure to disable the LaunchPlatformPlugin that comes with Frosty
